                This comes down to your goals, lifestyle and current fitness level. For those who are new or returning to exercise, aiming for two to three workouts each week is a great place to start to build your fitness while giving your body time to recover. Once that’s feeling easier, you can add more workouts to your weekly schedule! When your fitness increases, you might be doing between four and six workouts each week.

                The best time to work out is whenever you can fit it in! Have a look at your schedule and figure out what time of day is best for you.

                If your routine is flexible, think about when you feel most energetic, or when you would prefer to exercise. Morning workouts can be an energising way to start the day for some, while others prefer working out in the afternoons or evenings.

                This depends on what works for your lifestyle. For adults, the World Health Organisation recommends at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or at least 75-150 minutes each week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. No matter where your starting point is, our range of Sweat programs help you to build consistency in your training, offering workouts as quick as 10 minute and longer workouts that will take you around 45 minutes to complete. Remember, something is better than nothing! Even fitting in a daily walk can help you reach your fitness goals.

                You bet! We know it can be tempting to get straight into it, especially if you’re short on time, but a proper warm-up is really important. 

                According to the Mayo Clinic, warming up and cooling down may help reduce your risk of injury and improve performance. A good warm-up prepares your body for activity, raises your body temperature and increases blood flow to your muscles.
                
                A simple warm-up can be five minutes of cardio or some dynamic stretching of the muscles you are about to use. Each workout in the Sweat app comes with optional warm-ups you can follow.

            <span class="accordion-title">Should I do strength training, cardio or both? </span>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                We recommend a mixture of cardio and strength training. Alternating between the two is a good way to find balance. Why both and not just one? Because you want to reap the benefits of each! 

                According to the American Cancer Society, two to three strength-based workouts each week can result in significant health benefits, such as increased muscle mass, stronger bones, boosted metabolism, better posture, balance and joint flexibility. Research shows it also can boost heart health and have a positive impact on your mental health.

                Resistance training is how you increase your muscle mass, strength and overall health, but how you do it is up to you! Many women enjoy weight training with gym machines or free weights such as dumbbells, kettlebells or a barbell, while others prefer bodyweight workouts. 

                Try any of our zero equipment workouts and you’ll quickly realise bodyweight exercises can be just as challenging!
